ofxFunctionPointer
=====================================

An easy way to use function pointers in OpenFrameworks.
It works both with static and member functions and also includes a generic class for making the process of calling member function from other classes as painless as possible.

Everything in the addon is kept simple and easy to extend; the example is commented and should give a clear idea of how to use the code.
